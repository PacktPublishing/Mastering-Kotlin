This is the code repository for [Mastering Kotlin ](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-kotlin?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838555726), published by Packt.

**Learn advanced Kotlin programming techniques to build apps for Android, iOS, and the web**

## What is this book about?
Using Kotlin without taking advantage of its power and interoperability is like owning a sports car and never taking it out of the garage. While documentation and introductory resources can help you learn the basics of Kotlin, the fact that it’s a new language means that there are limited learning resources and code bases available in comparison to Java and other established languages.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Model data using interfaces, classes, and data classes 
* Grapple with practical interoperability challenges and solutions with Java 
* Build parallel apps using concurrency solutions such as coroutines 
* Explore functional, reactive, and imperative programming to build flexible apps 
* Discover how to build your own domain-specific language 
Embrace functional programming using the standard library and Arrow 
Delve into the use of Kotlin for frontend JavaScript development 
Build server-side services using Kotlin and Ktor
